## Protect the AWS Root User

**Authentication**
- When you create your AWS account, you use a combination of an email address and a password to verify your identity. If the user types in the correct email and password, the system assumes the user is allowed to enter and grants them access. This is the process of authentication.
- user tells who he/she is. Authentication ensures that the user is who they say they are. 
- **Usernames and passwords** are the most common types of authentication, but you may also work with other forms, such as **token-based authentication** or biometric data like a **fingerprint.** Authentication simply answers the question, **“Are you who you say you are?”**

**Authorization**
- Once you’re inside your AWS account, you might be curious about what actions you can take. This is where authorization comes in. 
- Authorization is the process of giving users permission to access AWS resources and services.
- Authorization determines **whether the user can perform an action**—whether it be to read, edit, delete, or create resources. Authorization answers the question, **“What actions can you perform?”**
 
**AWS Root User**
- root user has unrestricted access to everything in your account.
- root user is accessed by signing in with the **email address and password that you used to create the account**.

**AWS Root User Credentials**: AWS root user has two sets of credentials associated with it.
1. email address and password used to create the account
    - This allows you to access the AWS Management Console.
2. access keys:
    - allow you to make programmatic requests from the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) or AWS API.
    -  Access keys consist of two parts:
        1. An **access key ID**, for example, A2lAl5EXAMPLE
        2. A **secret access key**, for example, wJalrFE/KbEKxE


**Best Practices when working with AWS root user**
- Choose a strong password for the root user.
- Never share your root user password or access keys with anyone.
- Disable or delete the access keys associated with the root user.  
- Do not use the root user for administrative tasks or everyday tasks.
- Enable MFA on the root account.
- Follow the Principle of Least Privilege: 
    - Least privilege is a standard security principle that advises you to grant only the necessary permissions to do a particular job and nothing more. 
    - To implement least privilege for access control, start with the minimum set of permissions in an IAM policy and then grant additional permissions as necessary for a user, group, or role.

**single-factor-authentication**
- When you create an AWS account and first log in to that account, you use single-factor authentication. 
- It only requires one authentication method. In this case, you use a username and password to authenticate as the AWS root user. Other forms of single-factor authentication include a security pin or a security token.
- sometimes a user’s password is easy to guess. This is why using MFA has become so important in preventing unwanted account access. 

**multi-factor-authentication- MFA**
- MFA requires two or more authentication methods to verify an identity, pulling from three different categories of information:
    1. Something you **know**, such as a username and password, or pin number
    2. Something **you have**, such as a one-time passcode from a hardware device or mobile app
    3. Something **you are**, such as fingerprint or face scanning technology.
- Using a combination of this information enables systems to provide a layered approach to account access. Even though the first method of authentication, password, was cracked by a malicious user, it’s very unlikely that a second method of authentication, such as a fingerprint, would also be cracked.
- If you enable MFA on your root user, you are required to present a piece of identifying information from both the something you know category and the something you have category. The first piece of identifying information the user enters is an email and password combination. The second piece of information is a temporary numeric code provided by an MFA device.
- **Supported MFA Devices**
    - **Virtual MFA**: A software app that runs on a phone or other device that provides a one-time passcode. Authy, Duo Mobile, LastPass Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, Google Authenticator.
    - **Hardware**:A hardware device, generally a key fob or display card device that generates a one-time **six-digit numeric code.**
    - **U2F - Universal 2nd factor**: A hardware device that you plug into a USB port on your computer, YubiKey
