## Elastic Compute Cloud, EC2:
- a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
- It allows you to provision virtual servers called EC2 instances. Although AWS uses the phrase “web service” to describe it, it doesn’t mean that you are limited to running just web servers on your EC2 instances.
- In order to create an EC2 instance, you need to define:
    - Hardware specifications, like CPU, memory, network, and storage.
    - Logical configurations, like networking location, firewall rules, authentication, and the operating system of your choice.
- When launching an EC2 instance, the first setting you configure is **which operating system you want** by selecting an **Amazon Machine Image (AMI).**  


**What Is an AMI?**
- an AMI let you configure which operating system you want, you can also select storage mappings, the architecture type (such as 32-bit, 64-bit, or 64-bit ARM), and additional software installed.
- AWS supports a range of operating systems including Linux, Mac OS, Ubuntu, Windows, and more. To select the operating system for your server, you must choose an **Amazon Machine Image or an AMI**. 
- The **AMI contains** information about how you want your instance to be configured, including the operating system, possible applications to be pre-installed on that instance upon launch, and other configurations. 
- You can launch one or many instances from a single AMI, which would create multiple instances that all have the same configurations. 
- Some AMIs are provided by AWS whereas others are provided by the community and can be found using the AWS Marketplace. For example, **Amazon Linux 2** is the AMI we selected when we launched our employee directory application. This AMI is provided by AWS and it is essentially a pre-built EC2-optimized Linux image that has long-term support provided by AWS. 


**What Is the Relationship Between AMIs and EC2 Instances**
- EC2 instances are live instantiations of what is defined in an AMI, much like a cake is a live instantiation of a cake recipe. If you are familiar with software development, you can also see this kind of relationship between a Class (AMI) and an Object.(EC2 instance)
- A Class is something you model and define, while an object is something you interact with. In this case, the AMI is how you model and define your instance, while the EC2 instance is the entity you interact with, where you can install your web server, and serve your content to users.
- **When you launch a new instance**, 
    1. AWS allocates a virtual machine that runs on a hypervisor. 
    2. Then the AMI you selected is copied to the root device volume, which contains the image used to boot the volume. 
    3. In the end, you get a server you can connect to and install packages and any additional software. In this case, you install a web server along with the properly configured source code of your employee directory app.

- One advantage of using AMIs is that they **are reusable**. 
    - You might choose a Linux-based AMI and configure the HTTP server, application packages, and any additional software you may need to run your application.
    - If you wanted to create a second EC2 instance with the same configurations, how can you easily do that? One option is to go through the entire instance creation and configuration process and try to match your settings to the first instance. However, this is time consuming and leaves room for human error. 
    - The second, better option, is to create an AMI from your running instance and use this AMI to start a new instance. This way, your new instance will have all the same configurations as your current instance, because the configurations set in the AMIs are the same.

**instance type and size**
- Beyond the properties determined by the AMI, you can also configure the **instance type and size** which correspond to the amount of compute, memory, and network capabilities available per instance. 
- Different applications have different hardware requirements and choosing the instance type for your application gives you the ability to pick the hardware that it runs on. 
- The instance type you choose are grouped for use cases like **compute optimized**, **memory optimized**, **storage optimized**, and more. 
- Your instance sizing will depend on both the demands of your application and the anticipated size of your user base.

**What Makes Up an EC2 Instance?**
- EC2 instances are a combination of virtual processors (vCPUs), memory, network, and in some cases, instance storage and graphics processing units (GPUs). 
- AWS offers a variety of instances that differ based on performance. Some instances provide you with more capacity and others provide less. To get an overview of the capacity details for a particular instance, you should look at the **instance type**.
- **Instance types consist of a prefix identifying the type of workloads they’re optimized for, followed by a size.** For example, the instance type **c5.large** can be broken down into the following elements:
    - c5 determines the **instance family and generation number**. Here, the instance belongs to the fifth generation of instances in an instance family that’s optimized for generic computation.
    - large, which determines the **amount of instance capacity.**
- the **G instance family** are optimized for **graphics-intensive applications**, which would work best for use cases like 3D visualizations or video encoding. 
- Whereas the **M5 general purpose EC2 instance family** provides a balance of resources and are great for applications that use these resources in equal proportions, like web servers, our employee directory application for example, or things like code repositories.
- You can choose an initial EC2 instance type, evaluate its performance for your specific use case, and then later you can change to a different type that is better suited for your application.

**What Are Instance Families?**
1. **General purpose**
    - Provides a balance of compute, memory, and networking resources, and can be used for a variety of workloads.
    - Scale-out workloads such as web servers, containerized microservices, caching fleets, distributed data stores, and **development environments**.

2. **Compute optimized**
    - Ideal for compute-bound applications that benefit from high-performance processors.
    - **High-performance web servers**, **scientific modeling**, **batch processing**, distributed analytics, high-performance computing (HPC), machine/deep learning, ad serving, highly scalable multiplayer gaming.

3. **Memory optimized**
    - Designed to deliver fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory.
    - Memory-intensive applications such as **high-performance databases**, distributed web-scale in-memory caches, mid-size in-memory databases, **real-time big-data analytics**, and other enterprise applications.

4. **Accelerated computing**
    - Use hardware accelerators or co-processors to perform functions such as floating-point number calculations, graphics processing, or data pattern matching more efficiently than is possible with conventional CPUs.
    - **3D visualizations**, **graphics-intensive remote workstations**, 3D rendering, application streaming, **video encoding**, and other server-side graphics workloads.

5. **Storage optimized**
    - Designed for workloads that require high, sequential read and write access to large data sets on local storage. They are optimized to deliver tens of thousands of low-latency random I/O operations per second (IOPS) to applications that replicate their data across different instances.
    - **NoSQL databases**, such as Cassandra, MongoDB, and Redis, **in-memory databases**, **scale-out transactional databases**, ***data warehousing***, **Elasticsearch**, and **analytics**.


**Advantages of EC2:**
- The flexible and low cost nature of EC2 instances 
- ease of provisioning servers allows for programmers and businesses to innovate more quickly by spinning up servers for a short amount of time to run experiments and find optimal configurations for your applications. 
- EC2 offers a wide variety of hardware options to choose from. So you can optimize for your solutions by selecting the right EC2 instance type for your application. And then you can optimize even further by right sizing the resource, or selecting an instance size that is appropriate for your application and not over-provisioning like is often done on premises. 
- The ability to adapt changes and choose really specific configurations for your virtual machines, all through a couple of API calls, is very powerful.
