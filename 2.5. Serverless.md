## Introduction to Serverless
- If you run your code on Amazon EC2, AWS is responsible for the physical hardware and you are responsible for the logical controls, such as guest operating system, security and patching, networking, security, and scaling.
- If you run your ccode in containers on Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS, AWS is responsible for more of the container management, such as deploying containers across EC2 instances and managing the container cluster. However, when running ECS and EKS on EC2, you are still responsible for maintaining the underlying EC2 instances.
- If you want to deploy your workloads and applications without having to manage any EC2 instances, you can do that on AWS with serverless compute.

- When using Amazon EC2 or Container Services running on top of EC2 as a compute platform, you are required to set up and manage your fleet of instances. This means that you are responsible for patching your instances when new software packages come out or when new security updates come out. You're responsible for setting up the scaling of those instances, as well as ensuring that you've architected your solutions to be hosted in a highly available manner; which means deploying instances across at least two availability zones.it gives you a great deal of control over your solutions. Whatever happens on your instances and with your instances is in your hands. You can create simple or complicated setups that run and scale on AWS exactly to your specification. 
- not every single solution requires this level of control over the environment. Often times you might be looking to focus on your own business solutions and let somebody else take care of the undifferentiated heavy lifting for you. Or perhaps you just simply don't want to fiddle around with scaling controls and fault-tolerant designs, but you still want all the benefits of doing so. This is where the term Serverless comes in. A lot of AWS services are serverless in nature. 
- **Serverless means that you can not see or access the underlying infrastructure or instances that are hosting your solution**. Instead, the management of the underlying environment from a provisioning, scaling, fault-tolerance and maintenance perspective is taken care of for you. All you need to do is focus on your application.
- This means that serverless offerings are very convenient to use. You get to focus on the value of the service and what that service delivers, and not the underlying implementation details, thus reducing the number of operational support processes that you need to have in place. 
- idea of serverless impacts Shared Responsibility Model as well.example, with Amazon EC2 instances you are required to patch the operating system and security updates as they are released. With serverless offerings, you do not have access to the underlying operating system that is running the service. Therefore you are not responsible for carrying out tasks like patching. You are however still responsible for things like data encryption and access management. 
- One example of serverless compute is **AWS Fargate.**
    - AWS Fargate, is a serverless compute platform that you can run either ECS or EKS on top of. 
    - Previously, you learned that ECS and EKS run on clusters of EC2 instances. And in that case, you are using EC2 as the compute platform for your containers, and you also have tight control over those instances.
    - With AWS Fargate as the compute platform, you run your containers on a managed serverless compute platform. The scaling and fault-tolerance is built in and you don't need to worry about the underlying operating system or the environment. Instead, you just define your container, how you want your container to be run and then it scales on-demand. 
- think of AWS services as existing on a spectrum. On one side of the spectrum you have **convenience** and on the other you have **control**. Many services exist to give you control like Amazon EC2, whereas other services exist to give you convenience like the container hosting platform Fargate and the serverless compute AWS Lambda. 

**Go Serverless**
- Every definition of serverless mentions four aspects.
    - No servers to provision or manage.
    - Scales with usage.
    - You never pay for idle resources.
    - Availability and fault tolerance are built-in.
- With serverless, spend time on the things that differentiate your application, rather than spending time on ensuring availability, scaling, and managing servers.
- AWS has several serverless compute options, including AWS Fargate and AWS Lambda.


**Explore Serverless Containers with AWS Fargate**
- Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS enable you to run your containers in two modes.
    - Amazon EC2 mode
    - AWS Fargate mode
- AWS Fargate is a purpose-built serverless compute engine for containers. Fargate scales and manages the infrastructure, allowing developers to work on what they do best: application development.
- It achieves this by allocating the right amount of compute, eliminating the need to choose and handle EC2 Instances and cluster capacity and scaling. 
- Fargate supports both Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS architecture and provides workload isolation and improved security by design.
- AWS Fargate abstracts the EC2 instance so youâ€™re not required to manage it. However, with AWS Fargate, you can use all the same ECS primitives, APIs, and AWS integrations.
- It natively integrates with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Having native integration with Amazon VPC allows you to launch Fargate containers inside your network and control connectivity to your applications.
