## Role Based Access in AWS

Policies can be applied to AWS identities like **users** and **groups** to assign permissions. They also, however, can be applied to another AWS identity, **IAM Roles**. 

- **IAM role** is an identity that can be assumed by someone or something who needs temporary access to AWS credentials. 
- Most AWS API calls that are made must be signed and authenticated, but how does that process work? Well, from a high level, when you send an HTTP request to AWS, you must sign the request. This signing process allows AWS to verify your identity when a request is made and it's run through various security processes to ensure that a request is legit. 
- IAM users have associated credentials like an access key ID and secret access key that are used to sign requests. However, with regards to our architecture (employee directory app), the code running on the EC2 instance needs to sign the request sent to S3 for the employee photos. 
- Do no create an IAM user with credentials to be used by this app. do not hard-code credentials into this app at any point in time. So, how will the application gain access to the needed AWS access key ID and AWS secret access key to sign the API calls?: IAM roles.
- IAM roles are identities in AWS that, like an IAM user, also **have associated AWS credentials** used to sign requests. 
- However, IAM users have usernames and passwords as well as static credentials like the access key and secret access key, whereas 
    - **IAM roles do not have any login credentials like a username and password** 
    - the **credentials used to sign requests are programmatically acquired** 
    - **temporary in nature**
    - they are **automatically rotated**. 

- In our example, the EC2 instance will be assigned an IAM role whenever you launch it. This role can then be assumed by the application running on the virtual machine to gain access to the temporary credentials needed to sign the AWS API calls being made. 
- A role can be assumed by many different identities and they have many use cases. **The important thing to know about roles is that the credentials that they provide expire and roles are assumed programmatically**

- It's very common for roles to be **used for access between different AWS services.** Just because two resources exist in the same AWS account, it doesn't mean that they can send API calls to each other. If one AWS service needs to send an API call to another AWS service, it will most likely use role-based access where the AWS service assumes a role, gains access to the temporary credentials, and then sends the API call to the other AWS service who then verifies the request.

- Another identity that can assume an IAM role to gain access to AWS is **external identity providers**. For example, let's say you have a business that employs 5,000 technical employees and they all need access to an AWS account. You already have an identity provider in place that allows these employees to log into their laptops and access various corporate resources. Should you also now go create 5,000 IAM users for these employees to access AWS? Well, you can, but that doesn't sound very efficient. **You can leverage IAM roles to grant access to existing identities from your enterprise user directory. These are known as federated users.** AWS assigns a role to a federated user when access is requested through an identity provider. 
- We also have AWS services that can make this process a little bit easier, such as AWS Single Sign-On.

- Maintaining roles is easier than maintaining users. When you assume a role, IAM dynamically provides **temporary credentials** that expire after a defined period of time, between 15 minutes and 36 hours. 
- Users, on the other hand, have long-term credentials in the form of user name and password combinations or a set of access keys.
- User access keys only expire when you or the admin of your account rotates these keys. User login credentials expire if you have applied a password policy to your account that forces users to rotate their passwords.
