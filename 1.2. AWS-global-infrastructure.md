## AWS Global Infrastructure:

**Availability zones**
- AWS has planned for the events like natural disasters and other unavoidable accidents. The way they planned for it is through redundancy. 
- AWS clusters data centers together around the world. So AWS might have a second data center connected to the first data center through **redundant high speed** and **low latency links**. That way, if the first data center goes down, the second data center is still up and running. This **cluster of data centers** is called an Availability Zone or AZ
- An AZ consists of one or more data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity. 
- AZs also have a code name. Since theyâ€™re located inside Regions, they can be **addressed by appending a letter to the end of the Region code name.** For example: us-east-1a: an AZ in us-east-1 (Northern Virginia Region)


**Regions**
- Like data centers, AWS also clusters AZs together and also connects them with redundant high speed and low-latency links. **A cluster of AZs** is simply called a region.
- In AWS, you get to choose the location of your resources by picking a region. Regions are generally named by location so you can easily tell where they are.
- Each AWS Region is associated with a **geographical name** and a **Region code.**
- AWS Regions are **independent from one another**. This means that your data is not replicated from one Region to another, without your explicit consent and authorization.
- us-east-1: This is the first Region created in the east of the US. The geographical name for this Region is N. Virginia.
- there are four aspects you need to consider when deciding which AWS region to use: **CLaPS**
    1. **compliance**: If your application, company, or country that you live in requires you to handle your data and IT resources in a certain way. Do you have a requirement that your data must live in the UK boundaries? Then you should choose the London Region.
    2. **latency**: Latency is all about about how close your IT resources are to your user base.
    3. **price**: pricing can vary from region to region, due to diff. tax structures.
    4. **service availability**: if you want to begin using a new service on Day One after it launches, then you'll want to make sure it operates in the region that you're looking at running your infrastructure in.

**Scope AWS Services**
- When you operate a **Region-scoped service**, you only need to select the Region you want to use. If you are not asked to specify an individual AZ to deploy the service in, this is an indicator that the service operates on a Region-scope level. For region-scoped services, AWS automatically performs actions to increase data durability and availability.
- On the other hand, some services ask you to **specify an AZ**. With these services, you are often responsible for increasing the data durability and high availability of these resources.

**Maintain Resiliency**
- To keep your application available, you need to maintain high availability and resiliency. A well-known best practice for cloud architecture is **to use Region-scoped, managed services**. These services come with availability and resiliency built in.
- When that is not possible, **make sure the workload is replicated across multiple AZs**. At a minimum, you should use two AZs. If one entire AZ fails, your application will have infrastructure up and running in at least a second AZ to take over the traffic.
