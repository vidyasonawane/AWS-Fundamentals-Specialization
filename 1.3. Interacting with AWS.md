**Interacting with AWS**
- Instead of physically managing my infrastructure, we can logically manage it through the AWS **application programming interface or API.**
- Every action you make in AWS is an API call that is authenticated and authorized.
- when I create, delete or change any AWS resource, whether it's a virtual server or a storage system for employee photos, I use API calls to AWS to do that.
- 3 ways:

1. **AWS Management Console**: 
    - a web-based console that you log into from your browser.
    - Changing the Region directs the browser to make requests to a whole different AWS Region, represented by a different subdomain. If I change the region to Paris, you're making requests to eu-west-3.console.aws.amazon.com
2. **AWS Command Line Interface**: 
    - use the terminal on your machine to create and configure AWS services and automate them with scripts.
    - The AWS CLI is open-source, and there are installers available for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS. 
    - `aws ec2 describe-instances`
3. **AWS Software Development Kits or SDKs**: 
    - API calls to AWS can also be performed by executing code with programming languages. You can do this by using AWS Software Development Kits (SDKs). 
    - SDKs are open-source and maintained by AWS for the most popular programming languages, such as C++, Go, Java, JavaScript, .NET, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby.
    - Developers commonly use AWS SDKs to integrate their application source code with AWS services.
    - ```
        import boto3
        ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
        response = ec2.describe_instances()
        print(response)
    ```
