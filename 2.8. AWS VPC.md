**Introduction to Amazon VPC**
- A VPC is **an isolated network you create in the AWS cloud**, similar to a traditional network in a data center. 
- When you create a VPC, you need to choose three main things:
    1. The  **name** of your VPC.
    2. A **Region** for  your VPC to live in. Each VPC spans multiple Availability Zones within the  Region you choose.
    3. A **IP range** for your VPC in *CIDR notation*. This determines the size of your network. Each VPC can  have up to four /16 IP ranges.
- Using this information, AWS will provision a network and IP addresses for that network.

**Create a Subnet**
- After you create your VPC, you need to create subnets inside of this network. Think of subnets as **smaller networks inside your base network**—or virtual area networks (VLANs) in a traditional, on-premises network. '
- In an on-premises network, the typical use case for subnets is:
    - to isolate or optimize network traffic. 
- In AWS, subnets are used for:
    - high availability and 
    - providing different connectivity options for your resources.

- When you create a subnet, you need to choose three settings:
    1. The  **VPC** you want your subnet to live in, in this case VPC (10.0.0.0/16).
    2. The **Availability  Zone** you want your subnet to live in, in this case AZ1.
    3. A **CIDR  block** for your subnet, which *must be a subset of the VPC CIDR block*, in  this case 10.0.0.0/24.

- When you launch an EC2 instance, you launch it inside a subnet, which will be located inside the Availability Zone you choose.

**High Availability with A VPC**
- When you create your subnets, keep high availability in mind. In order to maintain redundancy and fault tolerance, **create at least two subnets configured in two different Availability Zones.** 
- it’s important to consider that “everything fails all the time.” In this case, if one of these AZs fail, you still have your resources in another AZ available as backup.

**Reserved IPs**
- For AWS to configure your VPC appropriately, **AWS reserves five IP addresses in each subnet.** 
- These IP addresses are used for routing, Domain Name System (DNS), and network management.

- For example, consider a VPC with the IP range 10.0.0.0/22. The VPC includes 1,024 total IP addresses. This is divided into four equal-sized subnets, each with a /24 IP range with 256 IP addresses. Out of each of those IP ranges, there are only 251 IP addresses that can be used because AWS reserves five.
- Since AWS reserves these five IP addresses, it can impact how you design your network. 
- A common starting place for those who are new to the cloud is to create a VPC with a IP range of /16 and create subnets with a IP range of /24. This provides a large amount of IP addresses to work with at both the VPC and subnet level. 

**Gateways**
- **Internet Gateway**
    - To enable internet connectivity for your VPC, you need to create an internet gateway. Think of this gateway as similar to a modem. Just as a modem connects your computer to the internet, the **internet gateway connects your VPC to the internet**. 
    - Unlike your modem at home, which sometimes goes down or offline, an **internet gateway is highly available and scalable**. 
    - After you create an internet gateway, you then need to **attach it to your VPC.**

 
- **Virtual Private Gateway**
    - A virtual private gateway allows you **to connect your AWS VPC to another private network**. 
    - Once you create and attach a VGW to a VPC, the gateway acts as anchor on the AWS side of the connection. On the other side of the connection, you’ll need to connect a **customer gateway** to the other private network. 
    - A **customer gateway device is a physical device or software application on your side of the connection.** Once you have both gateways, you can then establish an encrypted VPN connection between the two sides.
