## AWS Identity and Access Management:

There are multiple places in employee directory application where we can identify the need for access control and credential management.
1. **Account level access**: access to an AWS account.
    - IAM allows you to create users and each individual person who needs access to your AWS account would have their own unique IAM user.
    - IAM users take care of the authentication and to take care of authorization, you can attach an IAM policy to a user in order to grant or deny permissions to take specific actions within an AWS account.action here referring to an AWS API call. Everything in AWS is an API call. 
    - IAM policies are JSON-based documents. 

2. The application code running on Amazon EC2 needs access to credentials to make the signed API call to Amazon S3.:
    - the code running the employee directory application is running on a virtual machine, being hosted by the service, Amazon EC2. That code will need to make API calls to the object storage service, Amazon S3, in order to read and write data like the images for the employees.  
    - all API calls in AWS must be both signed and authenticated in order to be allowed - no matter if the resources live in the same account or not.
    - use roll based access for this use case.

3. **App level access control**: 
    - to manage how users log in and use the employee directory application. people should have a valid credential, like a username and password to log into the app. That is access management on the application level.
    - IAM would **not** however be responsible for the application level access management. 

**What is IAM?**
- IAM is a web service that enables you to manage access to your AWS account and resources.
-  It also provides a centralized view of who and what are allowed inside your AWS account (authentication), and who and what have permissions to use and work with your AWS resources (authorization).
- With IAM, you can share access to an AWS account and resources without having to share your set of access keys or password. 
- You can also provide granular access to those working in your account, so that people and services only have permissions to the resources they need.

**IAM Features**
- IAM is **global and not specific to any one Region**. This means you can see and use your IAM configurations from any Region in the AWS Management Console.
- IAM is **integrated with many AWS services  by default**.
- You can establish **password policies** in IAM to specify complexity requirements and mandatory rotation periods for users.
- IAM **supports MFA.**
- IAM **supports identity federation**, which allows users who already have passwords elsewhere—for example, in your corporate network or with an internet identity provider—to get temporary access to your AWS account.
- Any AWS customer can use IAM; the service is offered at **no additional charge**.


**What Is an IAM User?**
- An IAM user represents a person or service that interacts with AWS. 
- You define the user within your AWS account. And any activity done by that user is billed to your account. 
- You can also add more users to your account as needed. 


**IAM User Credentials**
- An IAM user consists of a name and a set of credentials. When creating a user, you can choose to provide the user:
    - Access to the AWS Management Console
        - provide the users with a user name and password.
    - Programmatic access to the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) and AWS Application Programming Interface (AWS API)
        - AWS generates a set of access keys that can be used with the AWS CLI and AWS API.

- When you create an IAM user, you have the option to grant permissions directly at the user level. This can seem like a good idea if you have only one or a few users. However, as the number of users helping you build your solutions on AWS increases, it becomes more complicated to keep up with permissions. 


**IAM Group**
- An IAM group is a **collection of users.** 
- All users in the group inherit the permissions assigned to the group. It’s a more convenient and scalable way of managing permissions for users in your AWS account. This is why using IAM groups is a best practice.
- examples: 
    - A new developer joins your AWS account to help with your application. You simply create a new user and add them to the developer group, without having to think about which permissions they need.
    - A developer changes jobs and becomes a security engineer. Instead of editing the user’s permissions directly, you can instead remove them from the old group and add them to the new group that already has the correct level of access.
- Keep in mind the following features of groups.
    - **Groups can have many users.**
    - **Users can belong to many groups.**
    - **Groups cannot belong to groups.**


**IAM Policy:**
- The way you grant permissions in IAM is by using IAM policies.
- To manage access and provide permissions to AWS services and resources, you create IAM policies and attach them to IAM users, groups, and roles. 
- Whenever a user or role makes a request, AWS evaluates the policies associated with them. 
- policies are stored in AWS as JSON documents with several policy elements.
```
    {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [{
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "*",
            "Resource": "*"
        }]
```

- Putting all this information together, you have a policy that allows you to perform **all actions** on **all resources** inside your AWS account. This is what we refer to as an **administrator policy.**
    - **Version** element defines the version of the policy language. It specifies the language syntax rules that are needed by AWS to process a policy. To use all the available policy features, include "Version": "2012-10-17" before the "Statement" element in all your policies.
    - The **Effect** element specifies whether the statement will allow or deny access. In this policy, the Effect is "Allow", which means you’re providing access to a particular resource.
    - The **Action** element describes the type of action that should be allowed or denied. In the above policy, the action is "*". This is called a wildcard, and it is used to symbolize every action inside your AWS account.
    - The **Resource** element specifies the object or objects that the policy statement covers. In the policy example above, the resource is also the wildcard "*". This represents all resources inside your AWS console.

```
    {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [{
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iam: ChangePassword",
                "iam: GetUser"
                ]
            "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/${aws:username}"
        }]
    }
```
- this policy **allows** the IAM user to **change their own IAM password** (iam:ChangePassword) and **get information about their own user** (iam:GetUser). It only permits them to access their own credentials because the resource restricts access with the variable substitution ${aws:username}.

**Use IAM Appropriately**
- IAM is used to secure access to your AWS account and resources. It simply provides a way to create and manage users, groups, and roles to access resources within a single AWS account. 
- IAM is **not** used for website authentication and authorization, such as providing users of a website with sign-in and sign-up functionality. 
- IAM also does **not** support security controls for protecting operating systems and networks.
