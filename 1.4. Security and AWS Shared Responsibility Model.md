**Shared Responsibility Model**
- managing security and compliance is a shared responsibility between AWS and you.To depict this shared responsibility, AWS created the shared responsibility model. 
- security of the cloud: AWS
- security in the cloud: you.

**AWS is responsible for:**
- Protecting and securing AWS Regions, Availability Zones, and data centers, down to the physical security of the buildings.
- Managing the hardware, software, and networking components that run AWS services, such as the physical server, host operating systems, virtualization layers, and AWS networking components.
- The level of responsibility AWS has depends on the service. AWS classifies services into three different categories. 
    1. **Infrastructure services:**
        - Compute services, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)
        - AWS manages the **underlying infrastructure and foundation services**.
    2. **Container services**
        - Services that require less management from the customer, such as Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)
        - AWS manages the **underlying infrastructure and foundation services, operating system, and application platform.**
        - Container services refer to AWS abstracting application containers behind the scenes, not Docker container services.
    3. **Abstracted services**
        - Services that require very little management from the customer, such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
        - AWS operates the **infrastructure layer, operating system, and platforms, as well as server-side encryption and data protection.**

**Customer Responsible For:**
- security in the cloud.
- Customer responsibility will be determined by the AWS Cloud services that a customer selects.
- When using any AWS service, you’re responsible for properly configuring the service and your applications, as well as ensuring your data is secure.
- Using the three categories of AWS services, you can determine your level of responsibility for each AWS service you use. 
    1. **Infrastructure services:**
        - You **control the operating system and application platform**, as well as **encrypting, protecting, and managing customer data**.
        - AWS manages the underlying infrastructure and foundation services.
    2. **Container services**
        - You are responsible for **customer data, encrypting that data, and protecting it through network firewalls and backups.**
        - AWS manages the underlying infrastructure and foundation services, operating system, and application platform.
    3. **Abstracted services**
        - You are responsible for **managing customer data** and **protecting it through client-side encryption.**
        - AWS operates the infrastructure layer, operating system, and platforms, as well as server-side encryption and data protection.


It’s important to note that you maintain complete control of your data and are responsible for managing the security related to your content. Here are some examples of your responsibilities in context.

- **Choosing a Region** for AWS resources in accordance with data sovereignty regulations.
- **Implementing data protection mechanisms**, such as encryption and managing backups.
- Using **access control** to limit who has access to your data and AWS resources.
